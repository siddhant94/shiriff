LORD OF THE RINGS TRIVIA

1) Gandalf Slamming His Head In Bilbo's House Was Not Scripted.

2) The main door to Helm's Deep was built so heavily and so well that the real battering ram that was built to knock down the gates failed to do so until the door was weakened. Someone had built the door a little bit too well and Peter Jackson can be heard on the extended DVD commentary saying that if they had to defend a castle, he would want the Weta Workshop guys to build the door.

3) Ian McKellen's first day of shooting on the trilogy was Gandalf's first scene, arriving in Hobbiton. His second day of shooting was Gandalf's final scene of the film, at the Gray Havens.

4) Minas Tirith And Helm's Deep Were Built On The Same Set.

5) The three elven rings, Nenya, Narya and Vilya, were not forged by Sauron, but by an elf-lord named Celebrimbor.
